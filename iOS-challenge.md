## Overview

The goal of this challenge is to create an extremely simplified version of the Mimo app that can retrieve some very basic lessons from a server and display them.

- You won't be judged on the visual design at all, the only metric is your code.
- Part of this coding challenge is to read the documentation for the APIs provided to you.
- Use Git to track your changes and upload your Git repo either on [GitHub](https://github.com) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.com) to share it with us.

## Data structure

### Lessons

- Each lesson has an ID and JSON content that describes how the lesson is formatted
- Lessons come in a specific order

### Lesson progress

A lesson progress object is created when a lesson has been completed
It contains the following properties:
- The ID of the lesson
- A timestamp when the lesson started
- A timestamp when the lesson completed

## API





Create a simple iOS app written in Swift that lets users create a new Mimo account or lets user login with their existing Mimo account.

All of the authentication is done via [Auth0](https://auth0.com/)

- Auth0 Domain: `mimo-test.auth0.com`
- Auth0 Client ID: `PAn11swGbMAVXVDbSCpnITx5Utsxz1co`
- Auth0 Connection Name: `Username-Password-Authentication`

The app should have three views: One for login, one for signup and one to display information about the logged in user.

## Login VC

	- The VC should contain two fields: One for the email address and one for the password.
	- If the email doesn't exist upon login, display an error message stating that the account doesn't exist.

Relevant Auth0 API: https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication#resource-owner-password

## Signup VC

	- The VC should contain two fields: One for the email address and one for the password.
	- If the email exist upon signup, display an error message stating that the account already exists.

Relevant Auth0 API: https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication#signup
Use `openid profile email` for the `scope` parameter

## Account VC

	- The VC should display the email address of the user. Get this info from the JWT that you receive.
	- If you're brave enough, also display the Gravatar picture associated with the email address.
	- If the user isn't logged in or the JWT is expired, show an error message instead of the email (and the avatar).
